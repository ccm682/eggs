= Eggs
by Jimmy Schementi

A Silverlight behavior testing library (using IronRuby and Bacon)

== Dependencies

Make sure to run "git submodule init" and "git submodule update" to get
any dependencies.

bacon: a small RSpec clone
http://github.com/jschementi/bacon

== Sample

The sample depends on AgDLR:
git clone git://github.com/jschementi/agdlr.git

Clone it so agdlr and eggs are siblings. After doing a build of AgDLR, 
from their parent director, run:

agdlr\script\server /b:eggs/sample/index.html

You're default browser will open, and you should see the following:

rb> Eggs.current.run_tests
Sample bacon test
- should be true

1 specifications (1 requirements), 0 failures, 0 errors
=> nil

== Usage

From a IronRuby silverlight application:

require 'eggs'

# Tell eggs your test sets, and each test name in those sets
Eggs.config(
  :test_set => %W(
    console
    dynamic_application
    extension_types
    package
    window
  ),
  :another_test_set => %W(
    args
    auto_addref
    error_handle
    execfile
    issubclass
  )
)

# Do you like bacon with your eggs? I hope so ...
# Runs the tests with bacon
Eggs.run
